# Via-Kramer-Whiteboard Project
A project intended for the Coventry University Talent Showcase event where we hack into IoT (Internet of Things) e.g. the whiteboard. We managed to get full RCE without admintstrator priveladge for the kramer Go (debain) and the same for the windows version but pre-exisitng user needed with password.

## Guidelines
 Official guidelines to follow - "Clearly identify and describe any potentially harmful content in a disclaimer in the projectâ€™s README.md file or source code comments.
Provide a preferred contact method for any 3rd party abuse inquiries through a SECURITY.md file in the repository (e.g., "Please create an issue on this repository for any questions or concerns"). Such a contact method allows 3rd parties to reach out to project maintainers directly and potentially resolve concerns without the need to file abuse reports"

### `---Disclaimer---`
This repository contains a IOT VIA Kramer Go exploit created for educational purposes. It shall be deployed in a controlled environment for testing and results posted as shown.
